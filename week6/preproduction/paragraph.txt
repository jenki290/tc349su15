I think what works best for me is the mockup design method. It was nice to pick out my fonts and colors and have them all set up on a seperate document with the sytle tile but I'm not sure it would be efficient for me if it wasn't a required assignment. It probably made my work more collected though which is a good thing. I will have to start doing more planning like this in the future. I spent most of my time on the mockup and less on the style tile but that's the point right? i think the mockup will help me make my website faster but my lack of skills in photoshop might have made it overall a slower process, that should change in time.
